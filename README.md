# MCTS Tic-Tac-Toe ðŸ‘‰ [Read this in ä¸­æ–‡](README.zh-TW.md)
This is an implementation of the Tic-Tac-Toe game based on the Monte Carlo Tree Search (MCTS) algorithm, designed to demonstrate how to apply MCTS for decision-making and game intelligence.

## Features
- Game decision-making based on the MCTS algorithm
- Support for X and O players to compete
- Support for game state checking and endgame determination

## Installation
1. Clone this project:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/chen941008/TIC_TAC_TOE
   ```

## Build and Setup

This project uses CMake for compilation. Please follow the steps below to set up and build the project:

1. Make sure you have CMake installed (version 3.10 or above).
2. Create a build directory in the root of the project:
   ```bash
   mkdir build
   cd build
   ```
3. Configure the project using CMake:
   ```bash
   cmake ..
   ```
4. Build the project:
   ```bash
   cmake --build .
   ```
5. Run the project: After the build is completed, you should find the executable (e.g., `Simulation-only_version`) in the build directory. You can run it directly:
   ```bash
   ./Simulation-only_version
   ```

## Example
Assuming player X is the first player, the game process might look like this:

Input how many game you want to play.
1
Choose AI simulation mode: 1 = fixed simulation times, 2 = variable simulation times
1
Input how many iteration you want to run (must be greater than 10).
600000
Choose first or second player, input 1 or 2
